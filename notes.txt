- training oracle policy in pd_joint_pos control control_mode does not work
- ppo lstm implementation here weird. it should be like sb3 contrib rucurrent ppo. 
  but the implementation here is different - The LSTM hidden state used for training is 
  next_lstm_state, which is the hidden state from the START of the rollout (line 858), 
  not the hidden state that evolves through the sequence.
